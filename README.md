## Usage

- Download the latest release from
  [here](https://ramensoftware.com/downloads/uwpspy.zip).
- Run `UWPSpy.exe` and select the UWP application you want to spy on.
- A window with the application's UI elements will appear for each UI thread of
  the target application.
- A UWPSpy spying window can be closed, in which case it will become hidden. It
  can be shown again by running `UWPSpy.exe` again and selecting the same
  application.
- To completely stop spying on an application, its process must be terminated.

APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/xamlom/nf-xamlom-initializexamldiagnosticsex)
which were added in Windows 10, version 1703. Earlier versions of Windows are
not supported.
